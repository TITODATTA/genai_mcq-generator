       "{'text': 'The Mach–Zehnder interferometer shows that photons can exhibit wave-like interference.\\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[3] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the wave–particle duality observed at atomic scales,[4] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[5] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[6] and quantum physics was essential for the nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[7]\\n\\nAs physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[8] When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[9] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[10][11][12] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[13][14]\\n\\nQuantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch\\'s algorithm in 1985,[15] the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[16] and Simon\\'s algorithm in 1994.[17] These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[18] Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithms for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie–Hellman encryption protocols,[19] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing.[20] In 1996, Grover\\'s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[21][22] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[23] validating Feynman\\'s 1982 conjecture.[24]\\n\\nOver the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[25] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[26][27] and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[25] In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.[28][29][30] However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.[31][32]\\n\\nThe threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors,[33] yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains \"a rather distant dream\".[34] According to some researchers, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.[34]\\n\\nInvestment in quantum computing research has increased in the public and private sectors.[35][36] As one consulting firm summarized,[37]\\n\\n... investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing start-ups are proliferating. ... While quantum computing promises to help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage.\\n\\nWith focus on business management’s point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.[38]\\n\\nIn December 2023, physicists, for the first time, report the entanglement of individual molecules, which may have significant applications in quantum computing.[39] Also in December 2023, scientists at Harvard successfully created \"quantum circuits\" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.[40][41] The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton and funded by DARPA\\'s Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program.[42][43] Research efforts are ongoing to jumpstart quantum computing through topological and photonic approaches as well.[44]',\n",
